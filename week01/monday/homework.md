# MadLib!

1. Create a new "madlibs" repo on your GitHub account. Clone the empty repo to your local machine, and then `cd` into the repo directory.

2. Create a `madlib1.rb` file using the `touch` command. Open it in Sublime Text using the `subl` command.

3. Write a short (one paragraph) story, or find a funny article excerpt to satire.

4. Within `madlib1.rb`, prompt the user for 5-10 different text inputs, asking "Please enter a _noun/verb/adjective_:" for each. Set each of the user's inputs to a variable.

5. After collecting all of the user's input, print out your story text in the console with the user's values interpolated in.

6. Stage and commit your `madlib1.rb` file within your local repository. Use the commit message, "My first madlib". Push your commit up to GitHub.

7. Create another MadLib file in the "madlibs" repo, and repeat this process. This time, perform some funny math/string transformations on the user's input.
