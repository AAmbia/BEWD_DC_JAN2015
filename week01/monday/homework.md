# MadLib!

1. Create a `madlib.rb` file to run your madlib.

2. Write a short (2-3 paragraph) story, or find a funny article excerpt to satire.

3. Prompt the user for 5-10 different text inputs, asking "Please enter a _noun/verb/adjective_:" for each. Record each of the user's inputs.

4. Print your story text with the user's input interpolated into it.

5. Create another MadLib, and this time perform some funny transformations using string and number operations on the user's inputs.
